#summary LLVM with Clang and llvm-gcc compilers using MingGW on Windows

= Details =

Step 1. MinGW GUI installer <br />
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ <br />
   Optionally check g++ compiler and MSYS.

Step 2. You need to make sure that g++/gcc is in your system PATH <br />
   Run sysdm.cpl and click Environment Variables... button. Add C:\MinGW\bin; to the PATH environment variable. Or navigate Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment variables...

Step 3. Install CMake <br />
   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html <br />
   Do not add CMake to the system path

Step 4. Get LLVM and Clang source code <br />
   http://llvm.org/releases/

Step 5. Extract llvm sources. Use e.g. 7-zip to unpack .tgz and .tar files. Let C:\LLVM be working directory. After this step we are supposed to have llvm sources in C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8.

Step 6. Extract clang sources to C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8\tools. After this step we are supposed to have clang sources in C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8\tools\clang-2.8. However, this is not how it should be. Rename clang-2.8 to clang.

Step 7. Go to C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8. Create a build directory, let it be BUILD.

Step 8. In command prompt type: cd C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8\BUILD.

Step 9. Run "C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8\bin\cmake.exe" -G "MinGW Makefiles" .. Or "C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin\cmake.exe" -G "MinGW Makefiles" .. if CMake was installed with default installation path in Windows 7 64-bit.

Step 10. After the configuring is done run C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make <br />
   Optionally use parallel make with option -j and the amount of processor cores e.g. C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make -j 4 <br />
   It takes some time to get llvm and clang built (~1h).

Step 11. Add C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8\BUILD\bin to PATH environment variable. <br />
   This procedure allows Eclipse to see llvm and clang binaries.

Step 12. Download LLVM-GCC 4.2 Front End Binaries for Mingw32/x86 from http://llvm.org/releases/

Step 13. Unpack the contents of llvm-gcc4.2-2.8-x86-mingw32.tar into the C:\LLVM\llvm-2.8\BUILD directory.

Step 14. In Eclipse navigate Window -> Preferences -> LLVM <br />
   Add library stdc++ <br />
   Add library path to point where libstdc++ (C++ Standard Library) is located.
