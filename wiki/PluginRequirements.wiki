#summary Contains information about the requirements to use the LLVM toolchain support plugin

= Introduction =

LLVM toolchain plugin for Eclipse CDT has certain requirements that must be met. The plugin development is aimed for the newest CDT release and the sources depend on the newest CDT build. However support for older CDT versions are maintained by creating plugin jar packets that are modified to work with older versions.

= Details =

   * Eclipse CDT 7.0.1 is the recommended minimum CDT version, but the plugin is developed to compile on the latest stable CDT available
   * Java 5 JRE or newer (also a Eclipse requisition)
   * LLVM with Clang (follow the build instructions on http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
   * llvm-gcc compiler (if you're planning to use LLVM with GCC toolchain)
   * LD_LIBRARY_PATH system environment variable containing path to libstdc++ library (in order that C++ Standard Library can be found)
   * PATH system environment variable containing path to LLVM with Clang binaries (in order for LLVM tool executables to be found)
