<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When you launch an Eclipse workspace with LLVM plugin for the first time, you need to set the paths to LLVM binaries, headers and libraries. This is done in CDT from Window -> Preferences -> LLVM. Set LLVM installation folder to point where your llvm binaries are, include directory to point where your Clang includes are ($LLVM/Release/lib/clang/?.?/include) and library path to the directory where your llvm libraries live ($LLVM/Release/lib/). After the paths are set, you are ready to use the LLVM plugin.</p>
<p>If your paths in Preferences and LLVM are correctly set and the plugin is able to find your llvm binaries, you should have the option to use "LLVM with Clang (Linux/Windows)" toolchain and "LLVM with GCC (Linux/Windows) toolchain". The toolchains are available in project types of "executable", "static library" and "dynamic library" in both C and C++.</p>
<p>In order to compile C++ programs you may have to add the path to GCC library to LD_LIBRARY_PATH system environment variable.</p>
